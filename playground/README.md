# Playground

This folder contains all the scripts which I need to test and play around with in order to get an understanding of how the components would work.

## Purpose

The playground is a safe environment for experimentation and learning. Here, you can:

- Test new components before integrating them into the main project
- Experiment with different approaches to solve problems
- Learn how various components interact with each other
- Prototype new features quickly without affecting production code

## Usage

To use the playground:

1. Create a new Cargo project:
   ```bash
   cargo new my_playground
   cd my_playground
   ```

2. Add dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   # Add your required dependencies here
   ```

3. Edit the `src/main.rs` file to implement your experimental code:
   ```rust
   fn main() {
       println!("Welcome to my playground!");
       // Your experimental code goes here
   }
   ```

4. Run your playground project:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
